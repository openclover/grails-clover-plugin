/**
 * Requires the requesting user to be {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#isAuthenticated() authenticated} for the
 * request to continue, and if they're not, requires the user to login via the HTTP Basic protocol-specific challenge.
 * Upon successful login, they're allowed to continue on to the requested resource/url.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation is a 'clean room' Java implementation of Basic HTTP Authentication specification per
 * <a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2617.txt">RFC 2617</a>.
 * <p/>
 * Basic authentication functions as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A request comes in for a resource that requires authentication.</li>
 * <li>The server replies with a 401 response status, sets the <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> header, and the contents of a
 * page informing the user that the incoming resource requires authentication.</li>
 * <li>Upon receiving this <code>WWW-Authenticate</code> challenge from the server, the client then takes a
 * username and a password and puts them in the following format:
 * <p><code>username:password</code></p></li>
 * <li>This token is then base 64 encoded.</li>
 * <li>The client then sends another request for the same resource with the following header:<br/>
 * <p><code>Authorization: Basic <em>Base64_encoded_username_and_password</em></code></p></li>
 * </ol>
 * The {@link #onAccessDenied(javax.servlet.ServletRequest, javax.servlet.ServletResponse)} method will
 * only be called if the subject making the request is not
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.subject.Subject#isAuthenticated() authenticated}
 *
