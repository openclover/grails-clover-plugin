  <name>Clover Code Coverage for Grails</name>
  <description>\
A plugin that integrates Clover into GRAILS projects.
Clover is a Code Coverage tool that produces beautiful reports which are highly configurable and extensible.
Clover not only reports which lines of code were executed during a test run, it also reports which tests hit which lines of code.
Clover's reports include:
* Tag Clouds of your entire project that compare Complexity with Coverage
* A TreeMap to visualise the most complex, uncovered areas of your project
* Fully Cross Referenced HTML view of your source code
* Much more: See http://atlassian.com/clover
